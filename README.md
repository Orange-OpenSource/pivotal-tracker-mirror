# pivotal-tracker-mirror

This is a POC repository which aims are receiving mirrored github issues for pivotal tracker stories.

The goal of such mirror is to help the Cf community track progress of the CF pivotal tracker stories (currently there is no way for non project members to subscribe to story updates, see related [cf-dev thread](http://cf-dev.70369.x6.nabble.com/cf-dev-FW-issue-tracker-permissions-tt2763.html#a5014))

This is mirroring is automated using https://github.com/ArthurHlt/pivotaltrackermirror

Apologies if as part of this POC we have accidentally and transiently:
* added extra polutting [issue mentions](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions) while mirroring markdown contenrt of pivotal stories which uses the same mention markdown syntax: you may have received undesired mentions, please ignore them with our apologies.
* added extra polutting issue cross references. We'll try to find a way to cleanup this undesired pollution (by deleting this repo, making it private?)
